# C Perceptron

This repository contains the implementation of a simple [`Percepton`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) in [`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) based on the [`Veritasium`](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium) [video](https://youtu.be/GVsUOuSjvcg).

I also involved [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) to help me with the code. I thought it would be cool if a neural network would help me write another neural network.

## Demo

This demo is a timelapse that shows perceptron identify and distinguish input images from each other. Each frame shows the results after adjusting weights.
