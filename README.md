# C Perceptron

This repository contains implementation of a simple `Perceptron` in `C` based on the `Veritasium` [video](https://youtu.be/GVsUOuSjvcg).

I also involved [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) to help me with the code. I thought it would be cool if a neural network would help me write another neural network.

## Demo

A demo that shows perceptron identifying images. It is a timelapse of each phase that perceptron has made adjustments.
